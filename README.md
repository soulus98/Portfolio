# Portfolio
Just learning how to use git

Never used it before so trying to get used to it


This project is one of the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design projects: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

User Stories:<br />
User Story #1: My portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section.<br />
User Story #2: The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text.<br />
User Story #3: My portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects.<br />
User Story #4: The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project.<br />
User Story #5: The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.<br />
User Story #6: My portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar.<br />
User Story #7: The navbar should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.<br />
User Story #8: My portfolio should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.<br />
User Story #9: My portfolio should have at least one media query.<br />
User Story #10: The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.<br />
User Story #11: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.<br />


I left the colors horrible lol<br />
The images are google drive links so that it works local and in codepen where I submitted it to FCC<br />
<br />
For some reason User Story #9 (One media query) didn't work on local, only on codepen. Not sure why<br />
I never used any JS
